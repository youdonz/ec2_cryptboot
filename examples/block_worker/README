This is an example worker to go with the block_host example. It connects based on the contents
of the HOST file to a block_host server, then for each number generates a chain for a rainbow
table. Each chain involves 1 million applications of SHA1 and a function to generate a
pseudo-random 8 character password from each hash.

The pseudo-random passwords are generated by treating the hash as compressed data and using a
Huffman code to decompress it. This produces letters with approximately the right frequencies
for the sample given. There is no program for using these tables - just an example work load.
