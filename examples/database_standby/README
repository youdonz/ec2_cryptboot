Sets up a standby database, replaying transaction logs from an S3 bucket.

* Put AWS credentials and chosen S3 bucket in files in wal-e.d .
* Optionally add master database IP and standby password to recovery.conf .
* Create image and boot.

This starts a warm standby database, following the archives put in an S3 bucket.
At least one backup must already exist in that bucket.

If you want the database to start as soon as it catches up to the current state,
rather than continuing to wait and apply changes, copy recovery.conf.once over
recovery.conf . You can also add timeline arguments to this config and change
the CHOSEN_BACKUP file to do point-in-time recovery.
