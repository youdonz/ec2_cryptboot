Sets up a PostgreSQL database server with continuous backups to an S3 bucket.

WARNING: This archives backups and WAL logs to Amazon S3 and does not delete them.
You are responsible for watching these and all associated charges as per the
licence of this software.

The default setting of a WAL log every 5 minutes may archive ~4.5GB/day even with
low use to ensure the backup is within 5 minutes of fresh.

* Create an S3 bucket to hold the database backups and logs using the AWS management tools.
* Optionally, add a lifecycle policy to the bucket to delete old backups and logs.
* Put AWS credentials and chosen S3 bucket in files in wal-e.d .
* List client applications in client_applications.
* Create image and boot.

For each application listed in client_applications, a user and database of the
same name owned by that user is created. The passwords are randomly chosen and
put in /root/db.passwords. Log in to the DB server to get those.
